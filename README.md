# Kalah-WS1617
Kalah framework for the AI course at FAU WS16/17

`target/scala-2.12/kalah_2.12-1.0-javadoc.jar` and
`target/scala-2.12/api` contain the documentation,
`src` contains source files.

To implement your own agent, create a new class/object extending [[info.kwarc.teaching.AI.Kalah.Agent]]
and implement the required methods (init and move). For details see the documentation.

Make sure to name your class/object something *unique* as to not clash with other submissions!
